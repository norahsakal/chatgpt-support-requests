    "ChatGPT is OpenAI's new model family designed specifically for chat-based interactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the larger GPT-3 model, ChatGPT can consume a sequence of messages with metadata, which allows for more contextual understanding of conversations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Plus, the ChatGPT API is currently priced at only $0.002 per 1k tokens, which is 10x cheaper than the existing GPT-3.5 models.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you're looking to build a chatbot for support requests, ChatGPT is definitely worth considering."
